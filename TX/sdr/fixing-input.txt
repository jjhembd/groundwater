## Character encoding
SDRDownload files are encoded in CP1252 / MS-ANSI / Windows-1252.
A few fields have curly single quotes. These show up in vim as highlighted
<92>. They also confuse grep ("Binary file ... matches").
To fix them, convert to UTF-8:
iconv -f cp1252 -t utf8 input.txt > input-fixed-encoding.txt
See https://superuser.com/a/199872/1107869

Update: use sdr/fix-encoding.bash. Output to fix-encoding directory

## Problems with fix-encoding/WellData.txt
One line has a bunch of fields filled with double quotes: |"|"|"|...
presumably meant as ditto marks. This confuses Pandas... To fix it:
pandas.read_csv(file, delimiter='|', quote=3)
This turns of all quoting of delimiters.

Several fields include pipe characters. To check for false delimiters:
awk -F '|' '{print NF-1, NR, $0}' WellData.txt | awk '{if ($1 != 72) print}'
First field in output is the number of delimiters, 2nd is the line number

Lines with bad delimiter count: fix-encoding/WellData_bad-delimiters.txt

To fix them: check the report PDF for extra pipe characters. The report URL:
https://www2.twdb.texas.gov/apps/waterdatainteractive/GetReports.aspx?Num=<WellReportTrackingNumber>&Type=SDR-Well
Then manually edit the file. Edited output:
fix-encoding/WellData_fix-delimiters.txt

Delimiter problems in WellLithology.txt are easier to figure out.
awk -F '|' '{print NF-1, NR, $0}' WellLithology.txt | awk '{if ($1 != 4) print}' > WellLithology_bad-delimiters.txt
Fixed file: WellLithology_fix-delimiters.txt
