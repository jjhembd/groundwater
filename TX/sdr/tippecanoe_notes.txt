To check a tile: convert a .pbf to geojson and count features.
~/modules/vt2geojson/vt2geojson t01_default/0/0/0.pbf

The tile 6/14/26 covers most of Texas. It should have lots of features.

First test: output t01_default
# tippecanoe -e t01_default ../sdr_merge.geojson
Result: tile 6/14/26 is too sparse

t02: limit max zoom to 13
tippecanoe -z 13 -e t02_z13 ../sdr_merge.geojson
Result: better, still too sparse

t03: max zoom 12
tippecanoe -z 12 -e t02_z12 ../sdr_merge.geojson
Density about right. Question: does zoom 12 include everything?

t04: Follow the "Try this first" suggestion from the README at
https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe.
tippecanoe -zg -e t04_zg --drop-densest-as-needed ../sdr_merge.geojson
The printout says it's still dropping at zoom 8. And tiles are huge: >400KB!

t05: Like t04, but limit max tile size to 100KB, and extend to bigger zooms
until no more dropping
tippecanoe -zg -e t05_zg_ae_max100KB --drop-densest-as-needed \\
  --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping -M 100000 ../sdr_merge.geojson
Guessed maximum zoom is 8, but ends up extending to zoom 14
The 6-14-26 tile looks too uniform: we have lost all the density patterns

t06: Set zoom to 10 for initial decimation setting, but allow bigger zooms
if needed.
tippecanoe -z 10 -e t06_z10_ae_max100KB --drop-densest-as-needed \\
  --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping -M 100000 ../sdr_merge.geojson
Slight improvement in density variation, but still too uniform & sparse

t07: Set zoom to 11 (expandable), increase size limit to 150KB
tippecanoe -z 11 -e t07_z11_ae_max150KB --drop-densest-as-needed \\
  --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping -M 150000 ../sdr_merge.geojson
Looks reasonable? Mapbox tileset ID: jhembd.6oh2rpcv
After loading to Globelet: sparse areas are missing wells until you
zoom way in.

t08: Set zoom to 10, limit 'resolution' of tile (what does this mean??),
use 'gamma' to thin out dense spots, increase limit to 200KB
tippecanoe -e t08_z11_ae_max200KB -z 10 -d 9 -D 9 -g 2 -M200000 \\
  --drop-densest-as-needed --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping ../sdr_merge.geojson
NOTE: coordinates are rounded to nearest pixel? The 'resolution' is actually
coordinate precision!?!!! The file size is also much smaller, so who knows
what other strange things tippecanoe is doing.
